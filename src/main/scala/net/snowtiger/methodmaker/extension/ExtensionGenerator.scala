/**
 * The main class responsible for generating and analysing extensions for a given parent method. Currently this
 * must be a symmetric, non-Little treble-dominated method with a standard path (Plain, Treble-Dodging, or simple
 * Alliance with combinations of the two).
 * A list of method libraries should be supplied, so that we can look up matching library methods for any
 * extension found. The extension protocol used is a reasonably close match for that outlined in the current
 * Central Council Decision G: <a href="http://www.methods.org.uk/ccdecs.htm">http://www.methods.org.uk/ccdecs.htm</a>.
 * There are a few minor deviations, generally in order to improve the range and type of extensions we generate:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>(G)B.1 is not checked rigorously: we take an extension to be "indefinite" if it produces a regular series
 *  of extensions to at least stage 24.
 *  <li>We count as valid an extension which produces a short-course method (e.g. 3 leads in Royal), i.e. (G)B.4 is
 *  relaxed.
 *  <li>(G)B.6 "Wherever the parent has a place made adjacent to the path of a hunt bell, this characteristic must be
 *   retained" is not checked for. This condition is only likely to occur in methods with long places
 *   extending through two or more treble sections.
 *	<li>(G)B.7 "Wherever the parent has a place made adjacent to the path of a hunt bell, this characteristic must be
 *	 retained in" is checked for, unless the place is at lead or 2nds (or the equivalent for above work);
 *	 it seems more natural to allow these places stay close to lead in an expanded section (with suitable shiftAbove value),
 *	 although this case does not arise very often since it requires an AB extension below (not currently considered).
 *	 The treble-adjacency rule is taken to apply symmetrically, i.e. if either blow of the place is adjacent to the
 *	 treble then it applies.
 *	<li>(G)B.8 "Wherever the parent has working bells making adjacent places, this characteristic must be retained" is
 *	 checked for, except again for places at lead or 2nd's, because it seems natural to allow 12 to expand to 14,
 *	 producing an extension where the 12 place in the parent is degenerate due to lack of space.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Generation of extensions needs to be done carefully in order to gain good performance. The basic task is to create
 * two lists of "half-extensions", one each for the above and below work, then marry each possible combination together
 * to see if a working full extensions are produced. As an O(nm) algorithm this is potentially quite slow. The
 * following approach is used:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Process the parent method to pre-calculate as much data as possible. In particular it helps to expand
 *   every place notation in the half-lead by every possible stageOffset and for every shiftAbove value. These
 *   pre-expanded changes can then be used to directly build all following extensions, without needing to carry out
 *   any further processing. The {@link MethodPaths} class is the first step of the process, splitting the parent
 *   method into above and below works, and then delegating to two {@link HalfExtensionBuilder}s to build the tables
 *   or pre-expanded changes (known as {@link PathElement}s). The above work is reversed (both top-to-bottom and,
 *   within each place notation, left-to-right) so that we can process it identically to a below work.
 *	<li>The {@code HalfExtensionBuilder} is able to produce {@link HalfExtensionSeries} instances, which represent
 *	 an entire series of half-extensions of a given type (specific repeatFrom and shiftAbove value). The
 *	 {@code HalfExtensionSeries} class builds the first extension stage immediately, so that any path requirements
 *	 (treble or place adjacency rules) can be checked straightaway, and the extension discarded on failure. If
 *	 however the half-extension is valid, the full series can be built.
 *	<li>The {@link #findExtensions} method in this class is responsible for orchestrating the calls to the classes
 *	 above, generating all valid half-extensions, and also using the {@link HalfExtensionAccumulator} to de-dupe them,
 *	 thus ensuring extensions generating the same place notation are weeded out.
 *	<li>Finally, all remaining half-extensions for above and below works are paired together to create series of
 * 	 {@link FullExtension}s, again by this class. This process is slightly complicated by the fact that the above and
 * 	 below half-extensions may have different stageOffsets: in theory we might have to marry up an above work valid on
 * 	 every fourth stage (ABCD) with a below work valid at every sixth (ABCDEF). For each full extension, we check for
 *	 for validity before adding to an {@link ExtensionSeries}: it must generate the same type of method as the parent
 *	 (e.g Surprise with a PB leadhead).
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * To use this class, simply pass it a parent {@link NamedMethod}, and a method library list corresponding to the
 * same method type (e.g. the Surprise libraries), and call {@link #findExtensions} to return a list of valid
 * {@link ExtensionSeries} for the method. Each series will have a different type, and each is guaranteed to be different
 * (generating different higher-stage methods).
 * <p>
 * To get more information on the extension series for a method, including which ones are "indefinite", pass the
 * result list back into {@link #analyseExtensions}. This will produce an {@link AnalysedMethod} instance, containing
 * the parent method, all indefinite extension series, and some stats information about the number and type of extensions
 * found, including any anomalies such as where a library method with the same name exists at a higher stage, but doesn't
 * match any of the extensions found.
 * <p>
 * See also {@link SingleMethodExtensionGenerator}, which provides a main() method to call this class for a single
 * parent method and output the results, and {@link LibraryAnalyser}, which does the same for entire method libraries.
