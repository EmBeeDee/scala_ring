	* 0 3 4 5 6, then either of the LH groups C or D is available for lead 0. However, if we choose C, then
	* the next lead 3 must be A, and the remaining choices are fixed; conversely, choosing D gives a different
	* set of possible LH groups, starting from 3=C.
	* <p>
	* Finally, once we have found a composition (set of methods that have LH groups matching a splice), how do
	* we get back to the original splice and hence the order of methods? The order of output will be the sorted
	* order of the leadnums, so e.g. if the final splice consists entirely of f-type methods, these will be listed
	* in reverse order (leadnums 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 given). When writing out the composition, re-order the methods
	* by following the actual lh groups from leadnum 0.
